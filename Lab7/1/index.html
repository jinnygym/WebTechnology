        <!---- 3 columns ----->
        <p>A programming language is a formal language which comprises a set of instructions used to produce various
            kinds of output. Programming languages are used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>

                    lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended
